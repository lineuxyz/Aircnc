# Aircnc back end

## What is aircnc?


Aircnc is an app where we can rent and book corporate spots.

In this part of the project you can advertise spots locations for other devs to go, leaving the price field empty will be passed as free, or if you want to charge the spot just put the price, you can upload image and describe the technologies you accept.

## Before you start

Before putting the project to work you need to have the backend part already started. Now in the ``services`` folder in ``api.js`` put the address of your api.

You need to have a package manager installed, in this project ``yarn`` was used.

Now just run ```yarn start``` for the project to open in your browser.

If you do not have yarn installed here I leave the direct link to the download page:

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

The whole project was developed thanks to the knowledge gained from rocketseat week omnistack 9.0
